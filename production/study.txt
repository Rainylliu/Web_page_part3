Subject of my project: My time with COCO

Introduction of COCO:
COCO is a small coffee-colored teddy dog. Because his black round eyes and nose look like three buttons, I named him “Button” in Chinese. Because the pronunciation of COCO is similar to the pronunciation of the button in Chinese. I have always dreamed of owning a puppy since I was a child, and on one of my birthdays COCO came to my home. I first met COCO when he was a little guy curled up in the corner of his cage, and I decided right then and there that I wanted to take him home.

Time of COCO:
· Pick me up from school / Wait for me home.
When my parents came to pick me up from school, I could see COCO in the car. It would lie in the back of the car waiting for me to get in, and when I opened the door it would throw itself on top of me to welcome me. If COCO did not come to pick me up, it will obediently wait for me to go home at the door. What is very shocking to me is that COCO knows the time and it knows when I should go to school. Moreover, if he did not go to school with my parents to send me, he would be so sad that he had to wait for me at home. If I leave earlier than usual for school COCO does not want me to go out, and when I go out it will always cry in the house. If I go out at a normal time, he will go back to sleep in his nest.
