                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>When COCO was a kid, it used to tear paper towels with 
                       its mouth, scattering scraps all over the floor. Once 
                       when my mother caught it, it ran up the stairs and 
                       stuck its head out to confront her.</p>

                    <h4>Ball Lover</h4>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>COCO's favorite thing to play with is the ball. It likes 
                       to put the ball in your hand and wait for you to throw it. 
                       No matter how far you throw the ball it will take the ball 
                       back to your hand again and wait for you to continue to 
                       throw the ball, so over and over again tirelessly.</p>

                    <h4>Clever Puppy</h4>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>What is very shocking to me is that COCO knows the time 
                       and it knows when I should go to school. If I leave earlier
                       than usual for school COCO does not want me to go out, and 
                       when I go out it will always cry in the house. If I go out 
                       at a normal time, he will go back to sleep in his nest.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Every time you take a picture with COCO, it will be very 
                       cooperative to open its mouth and smile at the camera. I 
                       took a picture with my dog when I first arrived home last 
                       year, and he was very excited to see me, so he left a happy 
                       smile in front of the camera again.</p>

                    <h4>Strange sleeping</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>COCO sleeping posture is fun, it will be a variety of strange 
                       poses to make people feel very funny. It often likes to lie 
                       flat on its belly to sleep, from the book that when the puppies 
                       think it is in a very safe environment will show their belly. 
                       COCO also hides under the covers in winter, and when I return 
                       to the bedroom I find a puppy waiting for me under the covers.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Unlike other puppies, COCO is very clean. Every time it returns 
                       home after an activity outside it will wait dutifully for the family 
                       to scrub its paws and body. When bathing, he will not run around and 
                       stand in the bath waiting to be washed.</p>
